KyanBar - version 1.4
---------------------

NOTE:

Drag tracks from Spotify

You can now drag tracks from the Spotify app onto the nowplaying window. This
will add it to the office Jukebox playlist in the same way the web site does.

TODO:

Currently the new tracks are marked as being added by BRH. A fix for this is
needed in the Jukebox app, so will come in the next update.
