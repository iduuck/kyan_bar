KyanBar - version 1.5
---------------------

Voting and Dragging tracks from Spotify uses the open websocket and will
also be added with your jukebox username.

NOTE:

You will need to go to the preferences window and enter you jukebox user id.
(This can be fetched from the jukebox website via your account settings).
This is temporary, whilst a more robust solution is worked on, but it's so that
we can assign any voting or tracks added to you.

TODO:

Create a notification when a new dragged track is added.
